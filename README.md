<h1> Functions & Loops in R </h1>
This practical, hands-on guide to iterative coding in R was developed for the 2025 EFGH Data Core In-Person Orientation held August 18-21 in Nairobi, Kenya. It contains a presentation and accompanying code and anonymized data from EFGH.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<ul> <li> Understand the importance of automating repeated tasks and avoiding code duplication</li>  <br>
<li> Learn how to create for-loops and custom functions </li> <br>
  <li> Learn how to use for-loops, custom functions, map and apply separately and together to automate data management and analysis tasks in R</li> <br>
  <li> Understand the difference between the global environment and the excecution environment</li></ul> <br>

<h2> Topics covered </h2>
<ul> <li> For-loops</li>  <br>
<li> Custom functions</li> <br>
<li> Map</li> <br>
<li> Apply</li> </ul> <br>
